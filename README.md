# Exploring 67 years of LEGO
This is the first project I have done in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/10) using Python. 
The [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc.
